# NetLogo Robot Simulation

## Project Overview
In this NetLogo simulation, we delve into the dynamics of n autonomous robots navigating a two-dimensional plane (‚Ñù^2) using a "chase the farthest neighbor" algorithm. The visibility of these robots can be adjusted, ranging from unlimited to restricted within a certain radius. The main focus of this project is to analyze how this particular navigation strategy influences the collective behavior of the robots and examine whether it guarantees their eventual convergence towards a central focal point within a set timeframe.
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/)

### Installation
1. Download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open NetLogo.
3. Load the `Chasing_Your_Farthest_Neighboor.nlogo` model within NetLogo.

## Usage
1. **Configure Simulation Parameters**:
   - Set the number of robots (n).
   - Choose the visibility range (unlimited or limited).
   - Adjust any other relevant parameters in the NetLogo interface.

2. **Run the Simulation**:
   - Click the "Setup" button to initialize the simulation.
   - Click the "Go" button to start the simulation.
     
## Results
The robots will converge within finite time to one point.
