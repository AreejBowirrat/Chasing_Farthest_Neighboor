# NetLogo Robot Simulation

## Project Overview
This NetLogo project explores the behavior of n robots operating in a two-dimensional space (‚Ñù^2) while executing a "chase the farthest neighbor" policy. The robots' visibility range can be either unlimited or limited. The primary objective of this project is to investigate the impact of this specific motion law on the robots' behavior and ensure their convergence to a central point within a finite timeframe.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/)

### Installation
1. Download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open NetLogo.
3. Load the `Chasing_Your_Farthest_Neighboor.nlogo` model within NetLogo.

## Usage
1. **Configure Simulation Parameters**:
   - Set the number of robots (n).
   - Choose the visibility range (unlimited or limited).
   - Adjust any other relevant parameters in the NetLogo interface.

2. **Run the Simulation**:
   - Click the "Setup" button to initialize the simulation.
   - Click the "Go" button to start the simulation.
     
## Results
The robots will converge within finite time to one point.
